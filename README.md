<!-- splinekit/README.md --># splinekit: Spline Operations`splinekit` is a Python-based open-source software library aimed at the manipulation of one-dimensional periodic splines.## InstallationYou need at least `Python 3.10` to install `splinekit` (ideally `Python 3.12`). `Python 3.11` is also compatible.Create and activate your Python virtual environment (on Unix or MacOS)```shellpython -m venv splinekit-envsource splinekit-env/bin/activate```On Windows,```shellpython -m venv splinekit-env.splinekit-env/Scripts/Activate```To deactivate the environment use```shelldeactivate```Minimal requirement:```shellpip install numpy scipy sympy matplotlib```Simply install `splinekit` using `pip````shellpip install splinekit```## Formatting, Type Checking, and TestingFormatting and type checking is performed as```shelltox -e formattox -e type```The testing requires a valid environment with a supported Python version and `tox`installed. The tests are run with the following command (automatic pick of thePython version)```shelltox```The tests can also be launched for a specific Python version (must match the oneinstalled in the active environment)```shelltox -e py310tox -e py311tox -e py312```*IMPORTANT:* Since CI is not implemented, make sure to run, pass, and/or fix`tox -e format`, `tox -e type`, and `tox`.## PackagingUsing `tox` (preferred)```shelltox -e build```Using `hatch````shellhatch build -t wheel```## Development EnvironmentInstall `splinekit` development environment in editable mode```shellpip install -e .[dev]```## Building of the DocumentationTo build the Sphinx documentation, install `splinekit` doc dependencies```shellpip install -e .[docs]```Run the command from the splinekit root folder```shellsphinx-build docs/ _build/```Then, go to `_build/` and open `index.html` to navigate thedocumentation locally.### TroubleshootingIf you want to make a "clean" build, go to `docs` and manually delete thefolders `_build`, `auto_examples`, `gen_modules`, and the file `sg_execution_times.rst`.Why isn't this done automatically? Because Sphinx optimizes speed and removesredundant tasks, by not re-creating the examples notebooks if they have alreadybeen created. If you, for example, modify the name of the examples files, youwill have to delete at least the folder `auto_examples`. Otherwise, the oldexamples files will not have disappeared automatically and Sphinx will raisean internal warning referring to a toctree.
