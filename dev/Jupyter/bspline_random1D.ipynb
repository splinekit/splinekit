    "## Representation of Numbers\n",
    "Unlike in the antique world, the modern representation of numbers is\n",
    "positional, with digits. For instance, the number forty-two consists of\n",
    "the decimal digits $4$ and $2,$ with $4$ to the left and $2$ to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digits are the construction blocks of numbers. They are associated to\n",
    "a *base* (not a basis); in everyday life, the base is ten. In a computer,\n",
    "the binary base is two. Geeks would write octal numbers in base eight or\n",

    "base ten, one would notate\n",
    "\n",
    "$$42_{10}=2{\\mathrm{A}}_{16}=52_{8}=101010_{2}.$$\n",
    "In the positional notation, numbers are given by an infinite-length list of\n",
    "digits. Formally, if $b$ is the base, the synthesis of a nonnegative integer\n",
    "number $m\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ from its digits $\\left(d[k]\\right)_{k\\in{\\mathbb{N}}}$\n",
    "is understood to be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m=\\sum_{k\\in{\\mathbb{N}}}\\,d[k]\\,b^{k},\\;m\\in{\\mathbb{N}}.$$\n",
    "In written form, the digits are ordered by their index, from high index to\n",
    "low index. The leftmost digits of value zero are omitted, which makes for\n",
    "a finite-length string when the number $m$ is itself finite, even if the list\n",
    "of digits is implicitly infinite—at least, to the left.\n",
    "*   The finiteness property may change. Typically, your everyday-life number\n",
    "    may possibly be an integer, but sometimes it is also an irrational number\n",
    "    $x.$ In this case, the representation is extended by considering digits\n",
    "    $\\left(d[k]\\right)_{k\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}$ with both negative and positive\n",
    "    indices, like in\n",
    "\n",

    "    In written form, the zeros to the left are omitted, while the digits\n",
    "    to the right are truncated.\n",
    "*   The finiteness property may change in another way, with exotic numbers\n",
    "    called $p$-adic numbers. While you are not likely to ever encounter such\n",
    "    numbers in everyday life, know that one of their representations sees\n",
    "    them as integers with an infinite-length stream of digits to the left, all\n",
    "    of these digits being significant, in the same way as the digits of the\n",
    "    irrational numbers are significant to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now made the point that a number can be synthesized by an *infinite*\n",
    "sum of *indexed weights* (the digits) that multiply some *index-dependent operation*\n",
    "on a base (the canonic number $b$ to the power of the index). We have omitted\n",
    "details such as the handling of the sign, or discussed the assumption that the\n",
