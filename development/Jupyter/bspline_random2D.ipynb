    "# One-Dimensional Splines\n",
    "One-dimensional uniform polynomial splines are functions that map a real number to a\n",
    "real number. They follow a recipe whereby they are made of the sum of integer-shifted\n",
    "and weighted basis functions called B-splines. The weights are numbers that parameterize\n",
    "the spline and give its versatility. The bases are fixed functions that endow the\n",
    "spline with its unique characteristics—its smoothness, typically. Formally,\n",
    "we write a spline function $f$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f:{\\mathbb{R}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}},\\;x\\mapsto f(x)=\\sum_{k\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}\\,\n",
    "c[k]\\,\\beta^{n}(x-k).$$\n",
    "There, $c$ are the weights; moreover, $\\beta^{n}:{\\mathbb{R}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}$\n",
    "is the polynomial B-spline basis, where the superscript (not the power)\n",
    "$n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ gives the nonnegative integer degree of the basis. By linearity\n",
    "(sigma-linearity is not needed here because B-splines have a finite support),\n",
    "the spline $f$ inherits the properties of continuity and differentiability of the\n",
    "B-spline $\\beta^{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now set $n=3$ and focus on the integer translates of a cubic B-spline basis. It\n",
    "turns out that the spline built out of them will be made of piecewise (cubic) polynomials\n",
    "that join in such a way that a general cubic spline can always be differentiated thrice\n",
    "(but not necessarily four times), and this, for any arbitrary choice of coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, cubic splines are rather smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formulation, the freedom of choice of the coefficients is what gives splines\n",
    "their plasticity and allows them to be used as valuable continuously defined models of\n",
    "data. In particular, the model comes in handy whenever one desires to evaluate the\n",
    "spline at some arbitrary coordinate $x\\in{\\mathbb{R}}$, with the purpose of accessing\n",
    "the value $f(x)$. Even more, the true gradient $\\dot{f}$ and the derivatives of higher\n",
    "order such as $\\{\\ddot{f}, \\dddot{f},\\ldots\\}$ can also be accessed exactly, without\n",
    "having to resort to finite-difference approximations. This goes a long way to remove\n",
    "one layer of concern regarding the design of any algorithm that would rely on such\n",

    "# Two-Dimensional Spline Curves\n",
    "So far, we have discussed the one-dimensional spline $f:{\\mathbb{R}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}.$\n",
    "We want now to extend it by one extra dimension. There are two particularly simple ways to do so.\n",
    "*   Extend the dimension of the functional *domain*, as in\n",
    "    $f:{\\mathbb{R}}^{2}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}.$ This approach will typically be followed to handle\n",
    "    images, with a two-dimensional coordinate (the position) being mapped either to a grayscale value\n",
    "    or to a value within one channel of a multichannel color image.\n",
    "*   Extend the dimension of the functional *range*, as in\n",
    "    ${\\mathbf{f}}:{\\mathbb{R}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^{2}.$ This approach will typically be followed\n",
    "    to handle curves, with a one-dimensional curvilinear coordinate being mapped to a two-dimensional\n",
    "    coordinate of the plane. This approach is the one we shall be following here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us decide that we want to represent a curve of the plane by a two-component Cartesian coordinate,\n",
    "each component being itself a spline. If we let $t$ be the curvilinear coordinate, then the curve is\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\mathbf{f}}:{\\mathbb{R}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^{2},\\;t\\mapsto{\\mathbf{f}}(t)=\n",
    "\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\sum_{k\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}\\,c_{1}[k]\\,\\beta^{n}(t-k)\\\\\n",
    "\\sum_{k\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}\\,c_{2}[k]\\,\\beta^{n}(t-k)\\end{array}\\right).$$\n",
    "An interesting question that arises is as follows: Is the curve smooth? Certainly, being splines, its\n",
    "Cartesian components are! To answer in a practical way our question about the smoothness of the\n",
    "curve as a whole (as opposed to the smoothness of its components in isolation), we provide below a\n",
    "piece of code that displays ${\\mathbf{f}}(t)$ for $t$ over an evolving running window. There, we let\n",
    "the two series $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ of spline coefficients be independent samples of a random variable\n",
    "that follows a Gaussian normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plot pieces of ${\\mathbf{f}}$ either in marroon or green, its knots being indicated by small black\n",
    "dots. At the leading edge of the curve, we add its osculating circle, which is locally tangent to the\n",
    "curve and shares its radius of curvature; we display it in lime color when it is on the left of the\n",
    "curve, and in red color when it is on the right. In the margins of the plot, one can find in yellow\n",
    "a representation of the horizontal and vertical components of ${\\mathbf{f}}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "The large pink dots are those places of the curve where the radius of the osculating circle is smaller\n",
    "than some threshold. This means that the curvature is very pronounced there, so that the curve is\n",
    "possibly singular at such locations. While the components are never singular, we observe that the\n",
    "(random) curve that is built out of them is singular or nearly singular at surprisingly many places.\n",
    "Those places where curve singularities exist are called *kinks*; they emerge from the joint interplay\n",
    "between the gradients and the second-order derivatives of the two Cartesian components of the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The osculating circle has a signed radius. When the radius is negative, the circle is on one side of \n",
    "the curve, and is on the other side when the radius is positive. Thus, there are three mechanisms at\n",
    "work to let the radius meet or cross the zero value and, possibly, give birth to pink kinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   A case in which the radius vanishes happens when the curve spirals inwards to a\n",
    "    limit point and then spirals outwards, *without* a change in the direction of rotation. This\n",
    "    corresponds to a zero of even multiplicity in the function $\\rho(t)$ that maps the curvilinear\n",
    "    coordinate $t$ to the radius $\\rho.$\n",
    "*   It can also happen that $\\rho(t)$ has zeros of odd multiplicity, in which case the radius does change\n",
    "    sign at those zeros. There, the osculating circle is transfered from one side of the curve to the\n",
    "    other one, a typical situation in which kinks are observed, often in a configuration where the curve\n",
    "    starts to spirals inwards, meets a reversal point, and spirals outwards *with* a change in the\n",
    "    direction of rotation.\n",
    "*   Finally, the radius also moves from one side of the curve to the other whenever\n",
    "    $\\lim_{\\tau\\downarrow0}\\rho(t-\\tau)=\\pm\\infty$ and $\\lim_{\\tau\\downarrow0}\\rho(t+\\tau)=\\mp\\infty.$\n",
    "    In those cases, the curve straightens, and the osculating circle becomes a straight line at the\n",
    "    location where $\\rho$ is singular. No kink arises in this benign situation and the change of side\n",
    "    of the osculating circle is graceful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, fake kinks are observed when the radius of the oscillating circle does not truly vanish, but\n",
    "just happens to become smaller than the threshold at which kinks are detected. This mostly corresponds\n",
    "to zeros of even multiplicity, without the zero value been actually met."
