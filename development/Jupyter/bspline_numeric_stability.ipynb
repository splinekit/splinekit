    "# Numeric Stability and Speed of B-Splines\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "Splines are piecewise polynomials that are built as the weighted sum of\n",
    "integer-shifted B-splines, themselves being piecewise polynomials, too.\n",
    "The weights are called the spline coefficients. Formally, a spline of\n",
    "degree $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ is the mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "$(1)$\n",
    "$$f:{\\mathbb{R}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}},\n",
    "x\\mapsto f(x)=\\sum_{k\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}\\,c[k]\\,\\beta^{n}(x-k),$$\n",
    "where $c$ are the spline coefficients and $\\beta^{n}$ the B-spline basis.\n",
    "To accurately evalute the spline $f$ at the argument $x$, it is crucial\n",
    "that the computation of the basis $\\beta^{n}$ be stable numerically.\n",
    "This is easy to achieve for small degrees; when the degree rises,\n",
    "however, one has to face the fact that the involved polynomials have a\n",
    "tendency to be made of delicately balancing terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we investigate how the numerical stability depends on the way\n",
    "B-splines are computed. The splinekit library proposes a remarquably\n",
    "stable strategy that results in the very fast and *constant-speed* evaluation\n",
    "of B-splines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classic Formula\n",
    "The classic, productive representation of the $m$th derivative of a\n",
    "B-spline of degree $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ and argument $x\\in{\\mathbb{R}}$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$(2)$\n",
    "$$\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}^{m}\\beta^{n}(x)}{{\\mathrm{d}}x^{m}}=\n",
    "\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}\\,\\left(-1\\right)^{k}\\,{n+1\\choose k}\\,\n",
    "\\varsigma^{n-m}(x+\\frac{n+1}{2}-k).$$\n",
    "Unfortunately, the term $\\left(-1\\right)^{k}$ results in contributions that\n",
    "tend to cancel each other. This spells numerical trouble, even if the\n",
    "polynomial simple element $\\varsigma^{n}(x)=\\frac{1}{2\\,n!}\\,\n",
    "{\\mathrm{sgn}}(x)\\,x^{n}$ has the flavor of a well-behaved canonic monomial.\n",
    "Another issue lies with the growth of the binomial coefficients with respect\n",
    "to the degree. (To compute a non-differentiated B-spline, simply set $m=0$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### De Boor\n",
    "Other computational recipes have been devised. For instance, the De Boor's\n",
    "recurrence relation expresses a B-spline of some degree as a weighted\n",
    "combination of B-splines of lesser degree. As defined in $(2)$, it turns\n",
    "out that $\\beta^{0}(x)=\\varsigma^{0}(x+\\frac{1}{2})-\\varsigma^{0}(x-\n",
    "\\frac{1}{2}).$ Then, it holds for $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}+1$ that\n",
    "\n",
    "$(3)$\n",
    "$$\\beta^{n}(x)=\\frac{1}{n}\\,\\left(\\left(x+\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)\\,\n",

    "\\beta^{n-1}(x-\\frac{1}{2})\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splinekit\n",
    "In this library, B-splines of degree $n=0$ are computed as in the classic\n",
    "or the De Boor's approach. B-splines of positive degree, however, are\n",
    "computed as the scalar product\n",
    "\n",
    "$(4)$\n",
    "$$\\beta^{n}(x)={\\mathbf{[\\![}}\\left|x\\right|<\\frac{n+1}{2}\\,\n",
    "{\\mathbf{]\\!]}}\\,\\left(w^{n}[r][\\cdot]\\right)^{{\\mathsf{T}}}\\,\n",
    "{\\mathbf{v}}^{n}(\\chi),$$\n",
    "where the notation ${\\mathbf{[\\![}}\\cdot\\,{\\mathbf{]\\!]}}$ is that of\n",
    "the Iverson bracket. Moreover, $r=\\left\\lceil\\xi\\right\\rceil\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}$\n",
    "for $\\xi=\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}-x\\right)$, and\n",
    "$\\chi=\\left(r-\\xi\\right)\\in[0,1)$. Finally,\n",
    "$\\left(w^{n}[r][\\cdot]\\right)^{{\\mathsf{T}}}$ is the\n",
    "$(r+1)$th row of the B-spline evaluation matrix ${\\mathbf{W}}^{n}\\in{\\mathbb{Q}}^{\\left(n+1\\right)\\times\\left(n+1\\right)}$\n",
    "and ${\\mathbf{v}}^{n}(\\chi)\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{n+1}$ is the Vandermonde\n",
    "vector of argument $\\chi$ and degree $n$. In this formulation of a\n",
    "B-spline, the fact that the Vandermonde vector has the domain $[0,1)$\n",
    "greatly favors numerical stability since the range of each of its\n",
    "components is also $[0,1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix ${\\mathbf{W}}^{n}$ depends on the degree only and can be\n",
    "precomputed and cached. Its component at the $(r+1)$th row and $(c+1)$th\n",
    "column is rational and is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$(5)$\n",
    "$$w_{r+1,c+1}^{n}=w^{n}[r][c]=\\frac{1}{c!}\\,\n",
    "\\left(\\left.\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}^{c}\\beta^{n}(x)}{{\\mathrm{d}}x^{c}}\n",
    "\\right|_{x=\\frac{n-1}{2}-r}+\\frac{1}{2}\\,\n",
    "{\\mathbf{[\\![}}c=n\\,{\\mathbf{]\\!]}}\\,\\left(-1\\right)^{n-r}\\,\n",
    "{n+1\\choose r+1}\\right).$$\n",
    "The B-spline derivatives that appear in $(5)$ are computed as\n",
    "rational numbers, through $(2)$. This leads to a rational value for\n",
    "$w^{n}[r][c]$, which is then cached as its ``float`` approximation.\n",
    "With this strategy, the balancing act that was governed in $(2)$ by\n",
    "the term $\\left(-1\\right)^{k}$ is now applied to rational values and\n",
    "can be achieved exactly in the rational domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Here, we want to compare four computational approaches.\n",
    "-   In the first (ground-truth) approach, we rely on the observation\n",
    "    that $\\beta^{n}:{\\mathbb{R}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}$\n",
    "    is defined in $(2)$ in such a way that $\\beta^{n}$ would map a\n",
    "    rational number to a number that is rational, too, so that\n",
    "    $\\beta^{n}:{\\mathbb{Q}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{Q}}$. This allows us\n",
    "    to compute exact, ground-truth values by relying on Python's\n",
    "    built-in ``Fraction`` type.\n",
    "-   In the second (classic) approach, we compute $\\beta^{n}$ as in\n",
    "    $(2)$, this time relying on Python's built-in ``float`` type.\n",
    "-   In the third (De Boor) approach, we compute $\\beta^{n}$ as in $(3)$,\n",
    "    again relying on Python's built-in ``float`` type.\n",
    "-   In the fourth (splinekit) approach, we compute $\\beta^{n}$ as in\n",
    "    $(4)$, relying on Python's built-in ``float`` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we measure is by how far the methods depart from the ground truth,\n",
    "in a mean-square sense. The error being most noticeable near the end\n",
    "of the left and right tails of the B-spline, this is where the error\n",
    "is computed. We also report the computational time."

    "    Yet, the trivial code proposed here comes the fastest over the small\n",
    "    range of degrees $n\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$. For such low degrees, however, one\n",
