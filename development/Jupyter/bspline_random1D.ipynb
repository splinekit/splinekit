    "## Representation of Numbers\n",
    "Unlike in the antique world, the modern representation of numbers is\n",
    "positional, with digits. For instance, the number forty-two consists of\n",
    "the decimal digits $4$ and $2,$ with $4$ to the left and $2$ to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digits are the construction blocks of numbers. They are associated to\n",
    "a *base* (not a basis); in everyday life, the base is ten. In a computer,\n",
    "the binary base is two. Geeks would write octal numbers in base eight or\n",
    "hexadecimal numbers in base sixteen. Assuming the subscript is written in\n",
    "base ten, one would notate\n",
    "\n",
    "$$42_{10}=2{\\mathrm{A}}_{16}=52_{8}=101010_{2}.$$\n",
    "In the positional notation, numbers are given by an infinite-length list of\n",
    "digits. Formally, if $b$ is the base, the synthesis of a nonnegative integer\n",
    "number $m\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ from its digits $\\left(d[k]\\right)_{k\\in{\\mathbb{N}}}$\n",
    "is understood to be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m=\\sum_{k\\in{\\mathbb{N}}}\\,d[k]\\,b^{k},\\;m\\in{\\mathbb{N}}.$$\n",
    "In written form, the digits are ordered by their index, from high index to\n",
    "low index. The leftmost digits of value zero are omitted, which makes for\n",
    "a finite-length string when the number $m$ is itself finite, even if the list\n",
    "of digits is implicitly infinite—at least, to the left.\n",
    "*   The finiteness property may change. Typically, your everyday-life number\n",
    "    may possibly be an integer, but sometimes it is also an irrational number\n",
    "    $x.$ In this case, the representation is extended by considering digits\n",
    "    $\\left(d[k]\\right)_{k\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}$ with both negative and positive\n",
    "    indices, like in\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$x=\\sum_{k\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}\\,d[k]\\,b^{k},\\;x\\in{\\mathbb{R}}.$$\n",
    "    In written form, the zeros to the left are omitted, while the digits\n",
    "    to the right are truncated.\n",
    "*   The finiteness property may change in another way, with exotic numbers\n",
    "    called $p$-adic numbers. While you are not likely to ever encounter such\n",
    "    numbers in everyday life, know that one of their representations sees\n",
    "    them as integers with an infinite-length stream of digits to the left, all\n",
    "    of these digits being significant, in the same way as the digits of the\n",
    "    irrational numbers are significant to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now made the point that a number can be synthesized by an *infinite*\n",
    "sum of *indexed weights* (the digits) that multiply some *index-dependent operation*\n",
    "on a base (the canonic number $b$ to the power of the index). We have omitted\n",
    "details such as the handling of the sign, or discussed the assumption that the\n",
    "base is an integer or, if it is indeed an integer, that the digits take\n",
